# heart-disease-ml
A machine learning project to predict heart disease risk using patient health indicators. Includes data preprocessing, modeling, and interpretation.

# ❤️ Heart Disease Risk Prediction

This project uses real patient data to develop a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of heart disease. It serves as part of my data science portfolio, combining epidemiological insight with modern ML practices.

## Data
The dataset comes from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

## Goals
- Clean and explore the dataset
- Build and compare machine learning models
- Interpret and explain model decisions
